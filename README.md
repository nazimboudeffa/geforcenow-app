# GForcenow Games List

This mini project will let you know :

* The list of all games available and updated
* Where to buy the game at the best price
* The best images that represents your game

Check some cool pens https://codepen.io/collection/DPOJVe

You can get the images directly from my Mega account but it's not like if you update them with the script https://mega.nz/#F!F19RGZ4K!tS5yH1VxPZW40f1-bsLmcw

# Licence

There is an issue on the number of call to the Steam Web API it's why you should use this script, but becarefull with python scripts on GitHub not all of them are correct and may supress an important file or folder from you computer, so it's why again I put a GNU GPL v3 in my repos
